There are multiple ways of bringing up an angular application. 
The easiest way and is using the angular comman line interface angular-cli

Depending on which machine you are using and if you are behind a firewall or not there are multiple ways of using angular's quickstart seed (which is a barebones app to start working from)

1.OPEN BASH AND check npm and node versions (should be node > 6 npm >3)
2.npm install -g @angular/cli
Alternately you can use the clone and create your project from the quickseed git
> cd .
> cd angular-cli
> npm link

Once you have established that anglular-cli is loaded 
(test by typing ng --version)

To create a project:
>cd ..
>ng new PROJECT-NAME (this takes a while loading up node_modules)
>cd PROJECT-NAME

>cd PROJECT-NAME
>ng build

--EXPRESS SET UP AND ADD TO PROJECT 
>npm install express body-parser --save

--CREATE A SERVER.JS file (outside of the src folder - in the main app)
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!')
})

--install MONGO
> npm install mongodb --save

To use the angular-cli for more organization : use like so:

PA25566@SALTON /e/SUBLIME_sandbox/meanApp4/mongoApp/src/app (master)
$ ng g component components/profile (CREATES A COMPONENT IN A COMPONENT FOLDER CALLED PROFILE)

PA25566@SALTON /e/SUBLIME_sandbox/meanApp4/mongoApp/src/app (master)
$ ng g service services/news-feed (CREATES A SERVICE IN A SERVICE  FOLDER CALLED NEWS-FEED)


PA25566@SALTON /e/SUBLIME_sandbox/meanApp4/mongoApp/src/app (master)
$ ng g class models/Article (CREATES A CLASS IN A MODEL FOLDER CALLED ARTICLE)

**** MAKE SURE THE PATHS WHEN IMPORTING THE COMPONENT/SERVICE/MODEL ARE CORRECT 
LIKE SO::::::import { UserDataService } from '../../services/user-data.service';

ALSO IN  IN THE APPMODULE

import { NewsFeedService } from './services/news-feed.service';
import { UserDataService } from './services/user-data.service';
